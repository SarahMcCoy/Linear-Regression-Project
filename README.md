# Linear-Regression-Project

## The Objective 
You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! 

## Project at a Glance:
- Objective: Use linear regression to find a relationship between one or more features to then draw a conclusion 
- Project Tools: Python (libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn) Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn 
- Data: Fake data set provided by the instructor (no real credit card numbers or emails were used) 

## Tasks 
1. Get Data 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
3. Train and Test Data 
4. Training the Model 
5. Predicting Test Data 
6. Evaluating The Models Performance 
7. Residuals 
8. Conclusion 

## Conclusion 
We still want to figure out the answer to the original question, do we focus our efforst on mobile app or website development? 

By interpreting the linear regression analysis using the coefficients, we can see that the company's website needs the most improvement. The company's mobile app is already performing very well. Therefore, the company should focus on developing the mobile app, taking into account membership features.

- Avg. Session Length Coefficient: 25.724256
- Time on App Coefficient: 38.597135
- Time on Website Coefficient: .459148
- Length of Membership Coefficient: 61.674732
